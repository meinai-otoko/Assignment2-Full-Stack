# Application and Architecture Explanation

## Application Functionality
The application is a microservices-based architecture designed to handle different aspects of an e-commerce system for BestBuy. It involves customer interaction (store-front), employee management (store-admin), and backend services for processing orders, managing products, and providing AI functionalities.

## Architecture Explanation

1. **User Interactions**:
   - **Customers** interact with the `store-front` application (built with Vue.js) to browse and purchase products.
   - **Employees** use the `store-admin` application (also built with Vue.js) to manage orders, products, and the backend services.

2. **Backend Services**:
   - **BestBuy-order-service (Node.js)**: Handles customer orders, communicates with RabbitMQ (`BestBuy-order-queue`), and ensures reliable order processing.
   - **BestBuy-product-service (Rust)**: Manages product-related data and inventory.
   - **BestBuy-makeline-service (Go)**: Handles order processing and preparation, interacting with the order database.

3. **Asynchronous Communication**:
   - **RabbitMQ (BestBuy-order-queue)**: Ensures asynchronous communication between services, particularly for order processing and coordination.

4. **Database**:
   - **Order Database (MongoDB)**: Stores all order-related data for processing, analytics, and consistency.

5. **AI and Image Processing**:
   - **BestBuy-ai-service (Python)**: Provides advanced functionalities such as customer assistance using a Large Language Model (GPT-4) and generates product images using an Image Generation Model (DALL-E).

## **Step by Step Instructions to deploy the application in a  Kubernetes cluster**  

## **Application Overview**  

The **Best Buy App** must include the following components:  

| Service              | Description                                                                 | Notes                                      |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Store-Front**      | Customer-facing app for browsing and placing orders.              |                                           |
| **Store-Admin**      | Employee-facing app for managing products and viewing orders .     |                                           |
| **Order-Service**    | Handles order creation and sends data to the managed order queue.          | Replace RabbitMQ with a managed service.  |
| **Product-Service**  | Handles CRUD operations for product data.                          |                                           |
| **Makeline-Service** | Processes and completes orders by reading from the order queue.       |                                           |
| **AI-Service**       | Generates product descriptions and images.                       | Use GPT-4 and DALL-E models.              |
| **Database**         | MongoDB for persisting order and product data.                            |                                           |

## **Project Requirements**  

### **1. Application Architecture**  
Design the application based on the provided diagram of Algonquin Pet Store(On Steroids).

### **2. Microservices Development**  
You can fork the Algonquin Pet Store repositories and use that as a starting point.

### **3. AI Integration**  
- Enable AI-generated product descriptions and images using GPT-4 and DALL-E models.  
- Use Azure OpenAI Services or OpenAI APIs for this integration.  

### **4. Kubernetes Deployment**  
- Use Kubernetes to deploy all services.  
- Create ConfigMaps and Secrets for managing application configurations and sensitive information.  
- Use StatefulSets for MongoDB.

## **Assignment Deliverables**  

Your submission must include the following:

### **1. GitHub Repository**
The GitHub repository must include:  
1. A `README.md` file containing:  
   - **Updated Application Architecture**:  
     - Draw the updated architecture diagram using `Draw.io` and include it in the README.  
   - **Application and Architecture Explanation**:  
     - Briefly explain the application functionality and how the architecture works.  
   - **Deployment Instructions**:  
     - Step-by-step instructions to deploy the application in a Kubernetes cluster.  
   - **Table of Microservice Repositories**:  
     - A table listing each microservice repository and its GitHub link.  
     - Example:
       | **Service**         | **Repository Link**                       |
       |---------------------|-------------------------------------------|
       | Store-Front         | `<GitHub Link>`                           |
       | Order-Service       | `<GitHub Link>`                           |
